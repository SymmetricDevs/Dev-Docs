# Project Structure

This section contains a high-level overview of the different components of the Supersymmetry modpack. 

## Github Repositories

### [Supersymmetry](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Supersymmetry)

This is the main repository for the modpack! It contains configuration files for the modpack. This is where you'd contribute to the questbook, update recipes, add mods, etc.

### [SuSy-Core](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Susy-Core)

This repository contains the principal Java code for the modpack. It also contains all of the assets of the modpack. We use [RetroFuturaGradle](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/RetroFuturaGradle) for the compilation.

### [Supercritical](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Supercritical)

This repository has our custom nuclear energy implementation. It contains nuclear-relevant recipes, items, multiblocks, and textures.
