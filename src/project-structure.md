# Project Structure

There are many, many different parts of the Supersymmetry project! These are some of the code bases that you can help contribute to: 

## Github Repositories

### [Supersymmetry](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Supersymmetry)

This is the main repository for the modpack! It contains configuration files for the modpack. This is where you'd contribute to the questbook, update recipes, add mods, etc.

### [Susy-Core](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Susy-Core)

This repository contains the principal Java code for the modpack. It also contains all of the assets of the modpack. We use [RetroFuturaGradle](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/RetroFuturaGradle) for the compilation.

### [Supercritical](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Supercritical)

This repository has our custom nuclear energy implementation. It contains nuclear-relevant recipes, items, multiblocks, and textures.

### [Dev-Docs](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Dev-Docs)

This repository contains the documentation for these projects as well as tutorials and tips for how to contribute! You can also press the edit button in the top-right corner if you want to start editing a page.
