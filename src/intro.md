Supersymmetry is a Minecraft modpack for 1.12 based around GregTech! But if you're here reading this, you probably already know that. What makes Supersymmetry any different from all those other packs?

## Supersymmetry fundamentally chooses realism.

We believe that science can create engaging, interesting gameplay, and that there is a target audience of people who would be interested in playing a game based around the basic rules of the universe. The main reason why one would want to develop this modpack is because one wants to get modded Minecraft players interested not only in STEM, but the scientific method itself. No modpack strives as much to change the worldview of its audience for the better than Supersymmetry.

## Supersymmetry creates an immersive industrial atmosphere for its players.

From the setting and lore of the game to the function and design of its machines, Supersymmetry attempts to create a cohesive brutalist and industrial backdrop for players to create on top of.

## Supersymmetry is not afraid to take its time.

While releases for Supersymmetry do occur every two weeks, us developers perform large quantities of research into the scientific literature to inform our gameplay. We also take care to iteratively develop our game design in response to feedback from the community.

If you are interested in contributing to a modpack committed to realism, atmosphere, and quality, you are free to join us.
