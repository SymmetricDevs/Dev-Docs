# Project Structure

There are many, many different parts of the Supersymmetry project! These are some of the code bases that you can help contribute to: 

## GitHub Repositories

### [Supersymmetry](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Supersymmetry)

This is the main repository for the modpack! It contains configuration files for the modpack. This is where you'd contribute to the questbook, update recipes, add mods, etc.

### [Susy-Core](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Susy-Core)

This repository contains the principal Java code for the modpack. It also contains all of the assets of the modpack. We use [RetroFuturaGradle](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/RetroFuturaGradle) for the compilation.

### [Supercritical](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Supercritical)

This repository has our custom nuclear energy implementation. It contains nuclear-relevant recipes, items, multiblocks, and textures.

### [Dev-Docs](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/Dev-Docs)

This repository contains the documentation for these projects as well as tutorials and tips for how to contribute! You can also press the edit button in the top-right corner if you want to start editing a page.

There are also a few projects of note from outside the SymmetricDevs organization.

### [GregTech](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech)

This is the mod that underpins our entire project! As of writing this (27 Aug 2025), this mod is still being ported to a new UI library, ModularUI. Help on this project makes our code more stable and efficient, and it attracts further attention to this version.

### [Modern Supersymmetry](https://github.com/ModernSymmetricDevs)

In the future, it is planned to port Supersymmetry to modern versions of Minecraft, primarily for the higher level of support and attention that comes with it. However, as of writing this (27 Aug 2025), most of the developers working on this are busy with other tasks. Currently, work is planned to shift to this version more once LuV tier is reached.
